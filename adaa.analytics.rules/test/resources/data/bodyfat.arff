% Short Summary:
% Lists estimates of the percentage of body fat determined by underwater
% weighing and various body circumference measurements for 252 men.
% 
% Classroom use of this data set:
% This data set can be used to illustrate multiple regression techniques.
% Accurate measurement of body fat is inconvenient/costly and it is 
% desirable to have easy methods of estimating body fat that are not
% inconvenient/costly.
% 
% More Details:
% A variety of popular health books suggest that the readers assess their
% health, at least in part, by estimating their percentage of body fat. In
% Bailey (1994), for instance, the reader can estimate body fat from tables
% using their age and various skin-fold measurements obtained by using a
% caliper. Other texts give predictive equations for body fat using body 
% circumference measurements (e.g. abdominal circumference) and/or skin-fold
% measurements. See, for instance, Behnke and Wilmore (1974), pp. 66-67;
% Wilmore (1976), p. 247; or Katch and McArdle (1977), pp. 120-132).
% 
% Percentage of body fat for an individual can be estimated once body density
% has been determined. Folks (e.g. Siri (1956)) assume that the body consists
% of two components - lean body tissue and fat tissue. Letting
% 
% D = Body Density (gm/cm^3)
% A = proportion of lean body tissue
% B = proportion of fat tissue (A+B=1)
% a = density of lean body tissue (gm/cm^3)
% b = density of fat tissue (gm/cm^3)
% 
% we have
% 
% D = 1/[(A/a) + (B/b)]
% 
% solving for B we find
% 
% B = (1/D)*[ab/(a-b)] - [b/(a-b)].
% 
% Using the estimates a=1.10 gm/cm^3 and b=0.90 gm/cm^3 (see Katch and McArdle
% (1977), p. 111 or Wilmore (1976), p. 123) we come up with "Siri's equation":
% 
% Percentage of Body Fat (i.e. 100*B) = 495/D - 450.
% 
% Volume, and hence body density, can be accurately measured a variety of ways.
% The technique of underwater weighing "computes body volume as the difference
% between body weight measured in air and weight measured during water
% submersion. In other words, body volume is equal to the loss of weight in
% water with the appropriate temperature correction for the water's density"
% (Katch and McArdle (1977), p. 113). Using this technique,
% 
% Body Density = WA/[(WA-WW)/c.f. - LV]
% 
% where
% 
% WA = Weight in air (kg)
% WW = Weight in water (kg)
% c.f. = Water correction factor (=1 at 39.2 deg F as one-gram of water
%        occupies exactly one cm^3 at this temperature, =.997 at 76-78 deg F)
% LV = Residual Lung Volume (liters)
% 
% (Katch and McArdle (1977), p. 115). Other methods of determining body volume
% are given in Behnke and Wilmore (1974), p. 22 ff.

% (Measurement standards are apparently those listed in Benhke and Wilmore
% (1974), pp. 45-48 where, for instance, the abdomen 2 circumference is 
% measured "laterally, at the level of the iliac crests, and anteriorly, at
% the umbilicus".)
